# Okay, so what next?
#
# How do we run these neural networks on the GPU?
#
# Training on GPU
# ----------------
# Just like how you transfer a Tensor onto the GPU, you transfer the neural
# net onto the GPU.
#
# Let's first define our device as the first visible cuda device if we have
# CUDA available:

device = torch.device('cuda:0' if torch.cuda.is_available() else 'cpu')

# Assuming that we are on a CUDA machine, this should print a CUDA device:

print(device)

########################################################################
# The rest of this section assumes that ``device`` is a CUDA device.
#
# Then these methods will recursively go over all modules and convert their
# parameters and buffers to CUDA tensors:
#
# .. code:: python
#
#     net.to(device)
#
#
# Remember that you will have to send the inputs and targets at every step
# to the GPU too:
#
# .. code:: python
#
#         inputs, labels = data[0].to(device), data[1].to(device)
#
# Why don't I notice MASSIVE speedup compared to CPU? Because your network
# is really small.
#
# **Exercise:** Try increasing the width of your network (argument 2 of
# the first ``nn.Conv2d``, and argument 1 of the second ``nn.Conv2d`` –
# they need to be the same number), see what kind of speedup you get.
#
# **Goals achieved**:
#
# - Understanding PyTorch's Tensor library and neural networks at a high level.
# - Train a small neural network to classify images
#
# Training on multiple GPUs
# -------------------------
# If you want to see even more MASSIVE speedup using all of your GPUs,
# please check out :doc:`data_parallel_tutorial`.
